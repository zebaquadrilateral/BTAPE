Background :Hierarchical processing underpins competition in tactile perceptual bistability ( F Darki et al. 2023)
Paradigm 2 Condition:
A: Alternating
S: Simultaneous
Stimulation blocks of 24 sec (30 stimuli) comprising 400 ms stimulation + 400 ms ISI
Inter-Block-Intervals 12 sec
Stimulation always the same (one block starting with strong/weak the other with weak/strong)
The condition is cued 2 sec before the start of the block with an “A” or an “S” for 1.5 sec 
Number of condition blocks is balanced
Order of blocks is randomized
(no jitter, no Null events)
Duration of the run is 6min:
360 sec  = (6 min) duration of Run
  36 sec  = Block (24 sec) + IBI (12 sec) 
  10 blocks = 5 blocks/condition

 Initial break of 4 sec block starts (-2 sec for display of condition)
 Last IBI 8 sec 
The Localizer:
Stimulation blocks of 8 sec (10 stimuli) comprising 400 ms stimulation + 400 ms ISI (as in the main experiment, just unilateral)
Inter-Block-Intervals 12 sec
Stimulation side (left, right) is randomized and balanced
(no jitter, no Null events)
Duration of the run is 6min:
360 sec  = (6min) duration of Run
  20 sec  = Block (8sec) + IBI (12 sec) 
18 blocks = 9 blocks/ side


 Initial break of 2 sec before first stimulation
 Last IBI 10 sec (to have the BOLD come down
